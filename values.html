        <h1>Codeup's Core Values</h1>
        <p>These are extremely important to us. These core values are the foundation of how we do business, how we conduct ourselves and how we interact with each other. We look to these core values as guidance when making decisions and developing strategies to fulfill our mission.</p>

        <h2>Deliver Excellence</h2>
        <p>Delivering excellence means that nothing I work on will ever be just "good enough". Delivering excellence means to uphold the highest standards of performance from both myself and my team.</p>

        <h2>Act with Integrity</h2>
        <p>Acting with integrity means always doing the right thing, whether or not it is easy or convenient. Acting with integrity is an essential component of delivering excellence, as it is an unwavering adherence to the highest standards and principles.</p>
